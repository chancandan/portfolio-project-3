## Game Design

### Flowchart

* The game's logic is represented using flowcharts, which makes it easy to understand and debug.
* I used www.draw.io's (https://app.diagrams.net/) free flowchart designer to spend some time thinking about my logic and planning directions needed to get the flow of my project just right. I found this part of the project the most challenging and trying to get the logic pinned down first wasn't as easy as I first thought it would be.<br>
